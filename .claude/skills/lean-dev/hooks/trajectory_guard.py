"""PostToolUse hook: turn the tool-use rules in SKILL.md §6 into measured feedback.

Advice in a skill body is a suggestion; this observes the trajectory and says something
only when a concrete, checkable waste pattern just happened:

  re-read      the same file range was already read this session and hasn't changed
  edit-recheck a file was read right after this turn's own successful edit to it
  blind-read   a large file was read whole with no search performed first
  recheck      a build/test command that already ran this session was run again

It stays quiet otherwise, and caps itself so the guard never becomes the bloat.

Env:
  LEAN_DEV_OFF=1        disable entirely
  LEAN_DEV_MAX_WARN=N   cap warnings per session (default 12)
